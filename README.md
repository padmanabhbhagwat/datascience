# datascience
This repository contains Data Science projects using Python that I have done with YBI Foundation, as an intern with the company.
The respository contains of three projects in Python for 3 aspects that I learnt while working with YBI, they're:
1.Machine Learning, 2.Data Science, 3.Business Analytics.
This repository is for everyone who wants to learn the basics of machine learning and data science using python as basic concepts are cleared through these projects.
I have used Google colaboratory for completing the project. There seems to be some kind of issue with Jupyter Notebook as it is not able to display pairplot function from seaborn.
